# twitter-cleanse-Flask-Vue
This is an updated version of my twitter-cleanse app but instead of using the jinja template engine supplied by flask, I use Vue to handle all of my frontend.
My Vue frontend is hosted on github pages using an isolated repo here: https://github.com/frrf/twitter-flask-vue-frontend
And my Flask backend API is hosted on Heroku
